## Sudoku Generator

This project aims to develop an api to generate random sudoku board and a client to render and make requests to the API. Download both `SudokuClient` and `SudokuAPI`.

## Requirements
The project was developed in an Unix environment but it should be running on windows and Linux OS as well given that all dependencies are installed.

## Dependencies

Download and install npm. Make sure to install the following dependencies manually in both SudokuAPI and SudokuClient directories.
```
sudo npm install npm@latest -g
sudo npm install -g typescript
sudo npm install express @types/express --save-dev
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli â€“unsafe-perm
sudo npm install bootstrap
```
Make sure to run `npm install` in the root directories (for both SudokuAPI and SudokuClient) to install all dependencies.
